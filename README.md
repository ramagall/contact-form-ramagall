## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned quite a bit more above responsive design. This time I focused on making sure every element I added was responsive before working on the next and I think it really paid off in the final result. 

### Continued development

I want to contiue to learn more about responsive design (this will likely be a proccess I work on forever), and I want to improve my Javascript skills to write better and better code.
